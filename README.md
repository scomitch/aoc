# Advent of Code
Repository for my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). 

## Language
Starting off in 2024, I'll be learning [Go]([https://adventofcode.com](https://go.dev/)) and writing solutions based on what i've learned from the language. AoC will be a great start point to understanding the fundamentals. Once I'm familiar enough, I'll move onto other languages for each year.
